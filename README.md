# AutoWikiaBot
My own version of Autowikiabot, this time without any of the original code from the fork. This is better than taking the time to refactor the other, as the code is just far too messy. As well, the APIs are different enough that a different development approach is required.
[Here](https://github.com/Timidger/autowikiabot-py) is the original repository, it is not very good code at all, but it is still (for the time being) the active code being ran to power the bot.
Hopefull, that will change soon.
